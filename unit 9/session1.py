# Problem 1: Merging Cookie Orders
# You run a local bakery and are given the roots of two binary trees order1 and order2 where each node in the binary tree represents the number of a certain cookie type the customer has ordered. To maximize efficiency, you want to bake enough of each type of cookie for both orders together.

# Given order1 and order2, merge the order together into one tree and return the root of the merged tree. To merge the orders, imagine that when place one tree on top of the other, some nodes of the two trees are overlapped while others are not. If two nodes overlap, then sum node values up as the new value of the merged node. Otherwise, the not None node will be used as the node of the new tree.

# Start the merging process from the root of both orders.

# Evaluate the time complexity of your function. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time complexity. Assume the input tree is balanced when calculating time complexity.

# Problem 2: Croquembouche
# You are designing a delicious croquembouche (a French dessert composed of a cone-shaped tower of cream puffs ðŸ˜‹), for a couple's wedding. They want the cream puffs to have a variety of flavors. You've finished your design and want to send it to the couple for review.
